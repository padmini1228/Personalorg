    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.Salutation} {!Account.FirstName} {!Account.LastName},

I am pleased to inform you that your application for finance has been approved

You will receive your offer letter within the next 5 working days. If your home finance is with regards to a new property purchase, you should instruct your solicitors if you have not already done so. 

Your offer letter may contain some special conditions in Section 6 which may require you to complete some actions before completion can take place. We recommend you read through this section with your solicitor.

Some important timeframes worth bearing in mind are noted below:

• Your offer letter is valid for 4 months from the date of issue.
• Your valuation report is valid for 6 months from the date of report.

Both the offer letter and valuation report must be in-date for completion to take place.

Moving forward your solicitor will be your main point of contact and will update you on the progress of the legal work. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact us at salessupport@alrayanbank.co.uk or call is +44 (0) 121 456 7878

Kind regards
Al Rayan Bank
