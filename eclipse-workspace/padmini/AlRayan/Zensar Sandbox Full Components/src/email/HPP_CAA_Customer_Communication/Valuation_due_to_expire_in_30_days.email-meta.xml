    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.Salutation} {!Account.FirstName} {!Account.LastName},

Please find below an update on the progress of your application for property finance from Al Rayan Bank.

The valuation report that was carried out on the property is valid for a period of six months from the date of the valuation. After this time, if your case has not completed, we will require a new valuation to be carried out and this will be at your expense.


Please note that your valuation report is due to expire in 30 daysâ€™ time. If your case does not complete within the next 30 days, we will require an updated valuation report, which may delay your completion date.


If you have any questions about this email or if you are aware of any issues that may prevent the completion of your case within the next 30 days, please do not hesitate to contact our Sales Support team on 0121 456 7878 or email salessupport@alrayanbank.co.uk, between 9.00am and 5.30pm, Monday to Friday.




Kind regards


Al Rayan Bank
