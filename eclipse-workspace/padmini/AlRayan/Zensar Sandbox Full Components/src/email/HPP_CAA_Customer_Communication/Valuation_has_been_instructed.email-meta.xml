    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.Salutation} {!Account.FirstName} {!Account.LastName},

Please find below an update on the progress of your application for property finance from Al Rayan Bank.

We are pleased to inform you that your valuation has now been instructed with our panel of Surveyors.


The time taken to complete and return the valuation depends on a number of factors that are not always under the control of the surveyor, and this is particularly the case where access to the property is via a third party.


We would expect the valuation to be completed and returned to us within six working days.


You do not need to contact us regarding this email, however, If you have not heard from us after six working days; please do not hesitate to speak to your Home Purchase Plan Specialist. Alternatively you can call our Customer Services team on 0800 40 80 786, between 9.00am and 7.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 9.00am and 1.00pm on Saturday.


Kind regards


Al Rayan Bank
