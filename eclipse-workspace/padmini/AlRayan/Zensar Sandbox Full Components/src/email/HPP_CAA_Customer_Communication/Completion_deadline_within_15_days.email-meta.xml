    <subject>Al Rayan Bank property finance application update</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.Salutation} {!Account.FirstName} {!Account.LastName},

Please find below an update on the progress of your application for property finance from Al Rayan Bank.

We recently sent you a letter advising that you are approaching the offer expiry deadline for your property.


Please note that Al Rayan Bank PLC offers expire four months after the date of the offer letter. You will not be able to complete with an offer that has expired.


If your property does not complete within the next 15 days, the offer will expire. Whilst we would be happy to issue you with a new offer, this would be subject to a re-assessment of your case by our Underwriting team, and there may be a requirement for you to provide us with further information.


If you have already responded to the letter we sent you, please disregard this email. If you respond to this email and subsequently receive our letter, please ignore the letter.


If you have any questions about this email, please do not hesitate to contact our Sales Support team on 0121 456 7878, between 9.00am and 5.30pm, Monday to Friday.




Kind regards


Al Rayan Bank
